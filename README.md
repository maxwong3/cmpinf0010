Datasets:

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data

desc from website: "Arrest data contains information on people taken into custody by City of Pittsburgh police officers. More serious crimes such as felony offenses are more likely to result in an arrest. However, arrests can occur as a result of other offenses, such as parole violations or a failure to appear for trial. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level.
This dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police. It does not contain information about incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (for example, campus police or Port Authority police)." (via. wprdc.org)


https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/non-traffic-citations

desc from website: "Non-traffic citations (NTCs, also known as "summary offenses") document low-level criminal offenses where a law enforcement officer or other authorized official issued a citation in lieu of arrest. These citations normally include a fine.â€¯In Pennsylvania, NTCs often include a notice to appear before a magistrate if the person does not provide a guilty plea. Offenses that normally result in a citation include disorderly conduct, loitering, harassment and retail theft.
This dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police. It does not contain incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (for example, campus police or Port Authority police).
Latinos are not included in this data as a race and they will not be reflected in this data." (via. wprdc.org)

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data

desc from website:

"The Police Blotter Archive contains crime incident data after it has been validated and processed to meet Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) standards, published on a nightly basis. This data validation process creates a data publishing delay of approximately thirty days. Users who require the most recent incident data should use the 30 Day Police Blotter. The 30 Day Police Blotter dataset contains more recent data, but has not yet been run through quality control and standardization procedures by the Police Bureau. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level.
This dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police, and does not contain incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (campus police, Port Authority, etc.)" (via. wprdc.org)
